// API CONSIDERATIONS

1) Implement restriction that users can only review a tour that they have actaully booked;

2) Implement nested booking routes: /tours/:id/bookings and /users/:id/bookings;

3) Improve tour dates: add a participants and a soldOut filed to each date. A date then becomes like an instance of the tour. Then, when a user books, they need to select one of the dates. A new booking will increase the number of participants in the date, until it is booked out (participants > maxGroupSize). So, when a user wants to book, you need to check if the tour on the slelcted date is still available;

4) Implement advanced authentication features: confirm user email, keep usere logged in with fresh tokens, two-factor authentication, etc.

// WEBSITE CONSIDERATIONS

1) Implement a sign up form, similar to the login form;

2) On the tour detail page, if a user has taken a tour, allow them add a review directly on the website. Implement a form for this;

3) Hide the entire booking section on the tour detail page if current user has already booked the tour (also prevent duplicate bookings on the model);

4) Implement "like tour" functionality, with favourite tour page.

5) On the user account page, implement the "My Reviews" page, where all reviews are displayed, and a user can edit them. (if you know React, this would be an amasing way to use the Natours API and train your skills!);

6) For administrators, implament all the "Manage" pages, where they can CRUD (create, read, update, delete) tours, users, reviews, and bookings.
